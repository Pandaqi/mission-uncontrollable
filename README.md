# Mission Uncontrollable

This is the full source code for a quick game made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020.

It was made in Godot 3. 

It can be played cooperatively ( = local multiplayer). You try to escape a randomly generated set of rooms while finding (and losing) the keyboard controls needed to actually play.

(I thought I already open sourced it, but I was wrong. It's an old game, so the project structure and code quality are probably sub par. If you find any files that shouldn't be here, let me know.)
